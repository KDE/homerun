* Special case the constructors of the new Plasma widgets so that they can be
passed a PlasmaScripting::Applet as parent
* Fixed the dialog handling so that it uses the standardConfigurationDialog()
and addStandardConfigurationPages() methods
 
2009-08-07  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Fixed typo in the type signature of the initExtenderItem() slot. Thanks to
David Palacio for reporting the bug

2009-07-19  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Use the new name 'extenderItemRestored()' for the signal to connect to
initExtenderItem()

2009-07-18  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add a Ruby version of the C++ extender tutorial example on Techbase

2009-07-17  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* If an applet has implemented an initExtenderItem() method, then connect the
new initScriptingExtenderItem() signal to it.

2009-06-16  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* The resize() method doesn't work with scripting plasmoids, so if it is used
output a warning message, and suggest adding a X-Plasma-DefautSize entry in
the metadata.desktop file.

2009-05-26  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add a callback for the configChanged() method in scripting applets

2009-04-27  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added some special casing for the new KDE 4.3 widgets, so they work with 
PLasmaScripting::Applet arguments

2009-04-22  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added PlasmaScripting::Containment and PlasmaScripting::PopupApplet classes,
  now that scripting containments and popups can be created

2009-02-10  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* For the methods that need to be special cased to work with 
  PlasmaScripting::Applet type arguments, add lower case/underscore versions
  of the methods

2009-02-05  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added various special casing to the Plasma::ToolTipManager class so you can
  pass a PlasmaScripting::Applet to the methods. Thanks to Mathieu Jobin for
  reporting the bug.

2008-12-22  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Changed the tiger applet example to find its tiger.svg resource from within
  the plasmoid package. Thanks to Rany Keddo for helping to get it working.

2008-12-01  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added updateAllSources() and removeSource() slots to the 
  PlasmScripting::DataEngine
* Add DBus notification to the time data engine example for when the config 
  changes

2008-11-18  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Fix problem with the ruby 'type()' method clashing with the one in
  Qt::GraphicsItem subclasses reported by David Palacio
* Added a 'dbpedia-queries' data engine for making SPARQL queries to DBpedia
  about music albums
* The sources() and init() methods needn't be implemented by a scripting
  data engine

2008-11-17  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Fixed missing constructor bug in Qt::GraphicsProxyWidget reported by David
  Palacio. Thanks to David for reporting the bug.
* Improved the names of the Ruby applet and dataengine examples
* Allow a PlasmaScripting::Applet to be a parent of all the Qt::GraphicsItem
  sub classes in their constructors

2008-11-05  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Fixed some bugs in the DataEngineScript class. The expected path was 
  'plasma/engines' whereas the plasmapkg tool installs them in 
  'plasma/dataengines'. The mainScript() and package() methods hadn't been
  implemented and were added.
* Added a 'ruby_time' example scripting data engine

2008-10-30  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Separated the script engine plugins from the plasma ruby extension and moved
  the script engine code to kdebase with the other script engines

2008-10-23  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Converted the webapplet to use the script engine api, and renamed it
  plasma_applet_ruby_webapplet

2008-08-15  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Re-added the ruby version of the plasmoidviewer app

2008-08-12  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Fix restoring of applet sizes.

2008-08-07  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* The marshaller for Plasma::DataEngine::Data was creating Qt::Variants with
  the wrong smoke pointer in the smokeruby_object struct, and this was causing
  a crash in the GC marking function.
* In PlasmaScripting::Applet, if a constant such as NoBackground is referenced
  and found to be missing, then look for it in Plasma::Applet.
* Fix bugs in the PlasmaScripting::Applet#showConfigurationInterface method
* Special case Plasma::Applet#id so it doesn't get a Ruby warning.
* In PlasmaScriptengineRuby::Applet the module name wasn't being derived 
  correctly from the Package path
* Add two versions of the clock applet
    * plasma_applet_ruby_clock uses the ScriptEngine api and is packaged as a
      plasmoid. It can be installed by typing the following command in the
      examples/applets directory:

      $ plasmapkg --install plasma_applet_ruby_clock --type plasmoid

    * analog-clock uses the C++ plugin api. Normally Ruby applets should be 
      written using the script engine api, and this example is only included
      to show how the two apis differ. The clocks are functionally identical.

2008-08-06  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add some fixes for the new Plasma::Frame and Plasma::Slider widgets

2008-07-03  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add slots and signals for scripting applets and data engines corresponding
  to the ones in Plasma::Applet and Plasma::DataEngine
* Change the install destination to plasma_scriptengine_ruby and the modules
  of the plugin classes to match

2008-06-30  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* For script engine based applets, add the directory where the mainScript was
  found to the ruby load path.

2008-06-29  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* If a method call is invoked on a PlasmaScripting::Applet, then relay it to
  the underlying Plasma::Applet in the script engine.
* Add an event filter to the RubyAppletScript::Applet class so that scripting
  applets can implement event method handling overrides.
* Change various methods in the QGraphicsView and Plasma api so that they can
  accept instances of PlasmaScripting::Applet, and the instance is substituted
  for the underlying Plasma::Applet in the ScriptEngine.

2008-06-28  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Make the Ruby ScriptEngine based plugins work
* Add a Ruby version of the Javascript Tiger applet
