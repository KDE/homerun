- XRRQueryExtension returns Bool, not Status
- Fix crash where Qt's QDesktopWidget returns multiple Xinerama screens;
  if we are being managed by RANDR, this number may be greater than the
- Fix a few memory leaks and uninitialized variables thanks to valgrind.
- Use the proper Xrandr.h macros for rotation and reflection masks in the
  actual number of screens as reported by ScreenCount in Xlib.
  RandR::Orientations enum.
- Don't remove the OutputGraphicsItems from a scene if they do not belong
  to it (why does QGraphicsScene return them in ::items() if they don't
  exist in the scene???)
- Add some useful accessors to OutputConfig to grab user configuration
  values for resolution, refresh rate, etc.
- Add preliminary multi-monitor ability; you can now set the absolute position
  of any screen.  Setting any other relationship other than "Absolute" currently
  clones all outputs to the largest display.
- Remove the "Active" checkbox and add a "Disabled" option in the resolution
  combo box instead; removes clutter and is clearer.
- Add the ability to get the preferred mode of a given connected output.
- Mark the preferred output mode (resolution) of a user as (Auto)
- Add missing proposeRefreshRate to RandROutput (was only in RandRCrtc)
- Remove performApplyOnStartup for KRandRModule - this makes sense for 
  krandrtray, which likely starts up with KDE4, but not for opening the
  KCModule, which should keep the active settings until the user makes a change.
- Remove some of my unnecessary output relationship code; found a much better
  way to do it :)
- More i18n contexts.
- The tray doesn't need to force querying infomation about each display/screen/
  output/crtc every time it prepares the context menu; it can receive randr
  events for a reason.
- Temporarily disable the logic to use the legacy RANDR API if the user has
  RANDR 1.2 but only one RROutput; this seems silly.
- Clean up the RandROutput and RandRCrtc APIs to use the proper RandR*
  classes instead of RRMode/Crtc/Output IDs from Xrandr.h to avoid
  headaches.
