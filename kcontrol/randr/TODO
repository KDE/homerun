Remaining known issues

General
	Does not yet work with multi-monitor setup using RANDR 1.2 (not tested with legacy RANDR)
	
Qt
	Font sizes on newly started apps after a resolution change are incorrect
		This doesn't appear to happen with non-Xft font rendering, Xft/Qt interaction?

Kwin
	Support different sized virtual desktops

RandR programs
	Support configuring different sized virtual desktops


-------------
RandR1.2 TODO

--> port the legacy interface to share the populate* functions
--> try to merge LegacyRandRConfig and RandRConfig
--> Get relative outputs working
--> Clean up the RandR* classes


trying to rotate a screen fails, the UI re-reads the correct values, but the screen remains off
    and there is no message about this
reverting doesn't work, it works in trunk
the startkde code is not up-to-date (and probably should be moved out of it)
