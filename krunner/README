KRunner provides a set of desktop services including:

 - a launch or "Run Command" dialog
 - screensaver activation and screen locking
 - application startup notification control

Launch Dialog
=============
The launch dialog accepts user input and passes that input through a series of
"runners". Each runner is a subclass of the Runner class and provides three
essential facilities:

1) whether or not it has matches for the given text input
2) providing a widget containing options associated with the runner, if any
3) activating a match

Runners may also be provided via plugins. See runners/search/ for an example.

Screensaver and screen locking
==============================
This functionality is provided by the D-Bus service described in
org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.xml and is made available on the session bus under the
service name org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver, path /ScreenSaver

The locking is managed by a small app found in lock/

Other Tidbits
=============
A restarting application so even a crash won't result in no krunner
A window for accepting search input, implemented in the Interface class
