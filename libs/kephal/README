Kephal provides an API for easier handling of multihead systems.

The architecture features features 2 main components:

* kded_kephal (service/)
    The KDED-module that provides all of the data and configuration-options.
    It will currently query for xrandr-extension and fallback to
    QDesktopWidget if XRandR 1.2 is not available.
    The directory 'service' contains the actual module class, kephald.*, and
    classes for the service and its dbus interface. Interfaces and shared logic
    are in shared/

* libkephal (client/)
    This is the lib that wraps all of Kephals DBus-API. It uses the same
    interface classes from shared/ as kded_kephal, but uses the
    dbus client stubs that access kded_kephal, and if this is not available, queries
    QDesktopWidget directly.

kephalapp and kephald are intended for development/testing.
They are not installed.

Some more infos are in READMEs in the subdirs or as API-Docs.
