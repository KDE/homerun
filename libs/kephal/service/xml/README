These classes allow a simple type of xml-data-binding. I'll add some
docs to this once i find some time, currently these are only for
internal use in Kephal.

configurations_xml.[h|cpp] has the actual xml-classes for Kephals
        xml-file.

all other files just offer the basics for schema-definition, loading
        and saving of xml.
